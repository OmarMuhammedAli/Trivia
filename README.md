# Full Stack Trivia API
This application is an interactive game where players can test their knowledge answering trivia questions. The main tasks were to create a Flask RESTful API, essential database models, and a test suite for implementing the following functionality:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies
Developers using this project should already have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

#### Frontend Dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Backend Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use ```npm start```. You can change the script in the ```package.json``` file.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

```bash
npm start
```

## Setting up the Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the `backend` directory and fill in the values:

```bash
DRIVER_NAME=......
USERNAME=......
PASSWORD=......
HOST=......
DB_PORT=......
DB_NAME=......
TEST_DB_NAME=trivia_test
TEST_DB_PATH=......
```

## Running the Server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

## Testing
To run the tests, run
```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```
Omit the dropdb command the first time you run tests.
